I've always considered myself a restless adventurer. After 8 years in general dental practice, I volunteered to go to Poland with <a href="http://ifesworld.org/" title="IFES">IFES</a> in 1992 for a year or two and taught English as a Foreign Language. I decided to stay and when it turned out going back to dentistry was too chanllenging, and computers became more available, I took a fascination for them.

The first application I wrote was Abacus, a desktop application in Visual Basic for teaching kids basic maths. Then Picturenary followed, a word game designed for teaching English. After writing a couple of articles for <a href="http://www.woe.edu.pl/" title="World of English">The World of English</a> magazine, I became their webmaster in 1998 and later developed a CMS based on phpBB forum software which also included a simple online store to sell our publications including magazines, books, audio tapes and CDs. Through one of my students who used to work in radio (she still does today), I was intoruduced to radio journalism and ran a weekly programme in Polish for over 4 years. It was a simple format - I read fictitious light-hearted letters to my brother about life as a foreigner in Poland. They had a special appeal to listeners as my Polish was, to say the obvious, not up to scratch.

It was back in the early days of PHP-based CMS solutions and I was looking for something unique. The CMS I wrote was born out of my search and was the foundation for phpEdu, a Learning Management Solution (LMS) I've always dreamt of developing myself. Then I found out about Drupal in 2005 and my search was over. I've continued working on phpEdu and have been involved in a number of other <a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/53175" "Drupal">Drupal projects</a> including StockAPI, Stock, Menu Valid Target, Worldclock etc. I've also been active in developing some modules for the upcoming Drupal 8 - Poll and Profile modules from core, Country, Language and Simple address fields.

Over the years, I've also had the privilege of working with other technologies such as Java, AngularJS and even wrote a jQuery plugin (<a href="https://github.com/dakala/jquery-ijedtiles" title="jQuery iJedTiles">jquery-ijedtiles</a>). My adventure even included learning a custom language, UnoScript, that used to power the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/" title="Taylor & Francis">informaworld</a> platform. Other packages I've worked with include SugarCRM and Symfony2.
